# Solving the Power Control Problem Using the Lagrangian Method

## Problem Overview

The **Power Control Problem** is a well-known problem in wireless communication systems, where the objective is to optimize the transmission power levels for each user in a network. The goal is to ensure efficient use of power while meeting specific performance requirements, such as Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) and quality of service (QoS) constraints. This problem is commonly encountered in systems like cellular networks, where users' transmissions interfere with one another.

This problem can be solved using the **Lagrangian Method**, a mathematical optimization technique that allows us to incorporate constraints (such as the minimum SIR for each user) into the objective function.
